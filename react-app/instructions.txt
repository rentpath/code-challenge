Coding Exercise Instructions (30 minutes)

If you look at the following URL https://api.github.com/users/dhh/events,
you will see a response containing data that is a history of the events of
dhh's interactions with github.

Your task is to update the react application to do the following:  

  • For the two users dhh and jashkenas

  • When the "Get Score" button is clicked, the application should read
  the JSON response from the URL and calculate a score for the combined
  users interactions.

  • The score is calculated from the "type" key value pair, where
    o PushEvent = 5 points
    o PullRequestReviewCommentEvent = 4 points
    o WatchEvent = 3 points.
    o CreateEvent = 2 points.
    o Every other event = 1 point.

  • Once calculated, the combined score should be rendered in place of the
  "n/a". 
  • Add two more fields below the combined score to represent each user's
  score with their username as a label

  *** Bonus *** 
  • Add a text input, whose value acts as a combined score multiplier.
  • Center the page content vertically.
